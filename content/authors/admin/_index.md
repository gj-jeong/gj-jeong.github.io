## About Me

I am an undergraduate student in <a href="https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/">Electrical Engineering, KAIST</a> (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). I am currently at <a href="https://ece.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> from the spring semester of 2024 for an exchange program and student research, advised by <a href="https://shimeng.ece.gatech.edu/">Shimeng Yu</a> and working with <a href="https://research.ibm.com/">IBM Research</a>. <br>
<br>
My research objective is in the area of analog circuit design and artificial intelligence application. Through my research, I would like to leverage artificial intelligence to address challenges in the field of traditional analog circuit design.
